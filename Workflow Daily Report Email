To extract data from an LMS (Learning Management System) and update it in a Power BI dashboard via SharePoint, you can follow these steps:

Extract Data from LMS:
API Integration: Check if your LMS provides an API for data extraction. Most modern LMS platforms offer APIs to access data programmatically.
Export Data: If API integration is not available, look for export options within the LMS to download data in formats like CSV, Excel, or JSON.
Upload Data to SharePoint:
Create a SharePoint List or Document Library: In SharePoint, create a list or document library to store the extracted data.
Upload Data: Manually upload the exported data files to the SharePoint list or document library. If using an API, you can automate this step using Power Automate.
Automate Data Upload with Power Automate:
Create a Flow: In Power Automate, create a flow to automate the data upload process.
Trigger: Set a trigger for the flow, such as a scheduled time or when a new file is added to a specific folder.
Actions: Add actions to extract data from the LMS (using HTTP requests if using an API) and upload it to SharePoint.
Connect SharePoint to Power BI:
Get Data: In Power BI Desktop, go to Home > Get Data > More > Online Services > SharePoint Online List.
Connect: Enter the URL of your SharePoint site and select the list or document library containing your data.
Load Data: Load the data into Power BI and create your report or dashboard.
Refresh Data in Power BI:
Scheduled Refresh: Set up a scheduled refresh in the Power BI service to ensure your dashboard is updated with the latest data from SharePoint.
Manual Refresh: You can also manually refresh the data in Power BI Desktop by clicking Refresh on the Home ribbon.
Example Flow in Power Automate
Trigger: Recurrence (e.g., daily at a specific time).
Action: HTTP request to extract data from LMS API.
Action: Create file in SharePoint document library.
Action: Send an email notification (optional).
This setup will ensure that your Power BI dashboard is always up-to-date with the latest data from your LMS, stored in SharePoint.
